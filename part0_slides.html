						# Making the web Svelter with SvelteKit

						### Part 0 - Introduction

						---
						## What is Svelte
						## and SvelteKit?

						- Svelte is a:
							- programming language
							- component framework
							- compiler
						- SvelteKit is a:
							- meta-framework built on top of Svelte
							- helps build full-stack application for the modern web.
---
						## Svelte - the language

						- Svelte is a programming language using the .svelte file extension.
						- A .svelte file contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript
						- Svelte will compile this down to vanilla JavaScript

						<pre><code data-line-numbers>
						<script>
							const name = "Joachim";
						</script>

						<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>

						<style>
							h1 {
								color: pink;
								font-size: 15px;
							}
						</style>
						</code></pre>
---
						## Svelte - The component library

						- Svelte is a component library, similar to React and Vue
						- Provides interesting features such as
							- Reactivity
							- Reactive Statements
							- Stores
							- No Virtual DOM (!!)
							- Stores
							- and much more
						---
						## Svelte - The compiler

						- Probably the most unique and interesting feature of Svelte
						- A Svelte app is compiled at build time into vanilla JavaScript code
							- You only ship the Svelte-library code you actually use in you app
						- Means that Svelte can add any number of features into its codebase without affecting you apps footprint

						---
						## Svelte Reactivity

						- Based on normal assignments, no special functions to learn
							- no React useState and setState
						- UI updates automatically when variables change
						- Here, whenever **increment()** is called, **count** gets updated, which also triggers the **UI** to update ***automagically***!

						<pre><code data-line-numbers>
						let count = 0;

						function increment() {
						  count += 1;
						}
						</code></pre>

						---
						## Svelte Reactivity statements

						- $: creates a reactive statement, which keeps up-to-date whenever any of its dependant-variables change
							- No need for complex state-management libraries

						<pre><code data-line-numbers>
						<script>
						let a = 2;
						let b = 4
						$: product = a * b;
						</script>

						<h1>Product is: {product}</h1>>
						</code></pre>
						---
						## Svelte Components

						- A .svelte file is a component containing its own markup, its own state and its own logic
						- A .svelte file can contains three code types:
							- JavaScript inside the **\<script\>**-tag
							- Markup: Normal HTML with markup logic contained within **{** and **}**
							- Styles that are component-specific inside the **\<style\>**-tag

						<pre><code data-line-numbers>
						<script>
							const name = "Joachim";
						</script>

						<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>

						<style>
							h1 {
								color: pink;
								font-size: 15px;
							}
						</style>
						</code></pre>

						---
						## Svelte - Stores

						- Allows multiple components to share state without passing data as props
						- Has a **subscribe()**-function that will notify components when the store value change
						- Stores are reactive
							- Any component subscribing to the store will see any change made to the store
						- A Svelte component can use the store via the $-handle
						- Stores can be readable, writable or derived

						## Svelte vs SvelteKit

						---
						## SvelteKit

						"SvelteKit is built on Svelte, a UI framework that uses a compiler to let you write breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser, using languages you already know â€” HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's a love letter to web development."

						<div style="text-align: right">- <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev" target="_blank">kit.svelte.dev</a></div>
						---
						## SvelteKit - The meta framework

						- SvelteKit adds additional features that are needed to build fuill-stack applications
							- Server-side rendering
							- Hooks
							- Form actions
							- API routes
							- Endpoints
							- Hydrization
							- etc

						---
						## SvelteKit - ServerSide Rendering

						- SvelteKit supports SSR, ensures your app is both fast and supports SEO
							- SSR sends a complete website to the browser
							- Hydration ensures SPA-features users expects from modern webapps

						---
						## SvelteKit - Routing

						- SvelteKit includes a built-in directory-based router that ensures:
							- URLs are human readable
							- Consistent directory-structure
							- Splits your code into essentialy "page-based components" and site-wide components

						---
						## SvelteKit - Routing

						---
						## SvelteKit - Adaptability

						- SvelteKit is designed to be adaptable
						- Has built-in support for multiple build and deploy targets
							- Cloudflare
							- Netlify
							- Node
							- Vercel
							- Static
							- A range of community developed adapters
